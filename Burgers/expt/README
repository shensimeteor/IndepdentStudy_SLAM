setting1: 
    use perturbed model as truth, 200 steps spin up
setting2:
    use real model as truth, but an offset step to create initial error
    (truth: 180-268.bin, background:200-288.bin)

QtEstimate: 
- not for data assimilation
- just see how covariance evolve, for stochastic Burgers models
- by running a large number of ensemble, with same IC, but each one is stochastic version (i.e. noise added at each time-step)

BtEstimate:
- similar to QtEstimate
- But not adding noise at each time-step, just initial time has noise, to see what initial time error grow

NumericScheme:
- try how the 2 schemes differ in the integration result. i.e. same IC, but with 2 schemes. 
IC can be
 -- just the full field
 -- full field + random independent noise
 -- full field + random but smooth noise
